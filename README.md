# TransferLearning

In this project I predict 2 models. One where I predict whether an image contains a bird, squirrel or nothing. Another where I classify 102 flowers.

**Purpose:** The purpose of this project was to increase my practice in transfer learning & to use bayesian hyperparameter tuning for base-model & top-layer-mlp hyperparameters.

# Model Results

## Obtaining Data
* **Flowers:**The flowers dataset can be obtained through the script which calls the tensorflow datasets, specifically the: *oxford_flowers* dataset. 
* **BirdsVsSquirrels:**The birds v squirrell dataset is a private dataset. If you wish to evaluate my models with the dataset feel free to reach out to me through this repository or through email.
