# TransferLearning

In this project I predict 2 models. One where I predict whether an image contains a bird, squirrel or nothing. Another where I classify 102 flowers.

**Purpose:** The purpose of this project was to increase my practice in transfer learning & to use bayesian hyperparameter tuning for base-model & top-layer-mlp hyperparameters.

# Competition Results
* I placed 1st out of ~30 Machine Learning Engineers for the Birds v. Squirrels model.
* I placed in the top 10 for the flowers multi-class classification. ( I ran out of time however, and if I used similar techiques for BvS I would've achieved a much higher score on this model as well. )
* Too see confusion matrics and model results please see the /results directory.

## Obtaining Data
* **Flowers:** The flowers dataset can be obtained through the script which calls the tensorflow datasets, specifically the: *oxford_flowers* dataset. 
* **BirdsVsSquirrels:** The birds v squirrell dataset is a private dataset. If you wish to evaluate my models with the dataset feel free to reach out to me through this repository or through email.
