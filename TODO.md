# Squirrel & Bird
## Initial Building
* [ ] Ensure each model works

## Hyperparameter Tuning - 
* [ ] Early Stopping
* [ ] Tuning for each model
* [ ] Load Each Model a ton of times I'm assuming?
* [ ] Turn it into train instead of val
* [ ] load in val dataset and test with it
* [ ] load all results in a pandas data frame
* [ ] Save pandas dataframe everytime a new model happens.
* [ ] Use Bayesian Tuning.
